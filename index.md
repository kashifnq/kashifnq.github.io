### Research interests

My interests are in **Cyber Security**, **Computer Networks**,  and **Wireless Communication**. This involves multidisciplinary research from computing and engineering sciences including **Vehicualr Ad Hoc Networks**, **Wireless Sensor Networks**, **Body Area Networks**, **Smart Cities**, **Internet of Things**, **Internet of Everything**, **Artificial Intelligence based Internet of Things**.  

  
I'm now working on some interesting **projects**:

*  [Edge and Cloud based Trust Mechanism for **Smart Cities** Networks](/trust) 📌
*  [Blockchain-Based Trust and Authentication Model for Detecting and Isolating Malicious Nodes in **Flying Ad Hoc Networks** ](/fanet)
*  [Internet of Everything: Evolution and Fundamental Concepts **Standrads, Technologies and Trend**](/internetofeverything) 
*  [Cybersecurity Vigilance and Security Engineering of **Internet of Everything** in speckle images](/cybervigelence) 


If you want to discuss about these areas of research, or **make a collaboration**, send me an [email](kashifnaseer.qureshi@ul.ie)  or follow me on <a href="https://x.com/kashifnq" target="_blank">x</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kashifnq" target="_blank">Linkdin</a>
