### About me

Kashif Naseer Qureshi is an Associate Professor of Cyber Security in the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering at the University of Limerick, Ireland. He is also actively involved in the Cyber Skills project, a HEA-HCI Pillar 3 initiative Ireland. He received a Ph.D. degree from the University of Technology Malaysia (UTM) and holds two master's degrees in Computer Science and Information Technology from reputable universities. He is the Co-Principal Investigator in Cyber Reconnaissance and Combat project funded by higher educa
tion commission. His research interests focus on the security, trust and privacy con
cerns for Internet of Everything (IoE), Internet of Vehicles (IoV), Electronic Vehicles (EV) charging management planning and recommendation systems, and Internet of Things (IoT) and use cases implementation in wireless and wired networks. He is active member of Lero, the Science Foundation Ireland Research Centre for Software in University of Limerick (UL). His name is included in top 2% Scientist for consecutive 3 years from Stanford university USA. He has published various high-impact factor papers in international journals and conference proceedings and served on several conferences IPCs and journal editorial boards. He has number of book chapters and 5 edited books in Springer, CRC and Elsiver Publishers related to Cybersecurity, Privacy and Trust architectures. He has also part of various research projects related to wireless communication, routing and CyberSecurity domains in the UK, China, Ireland, Malaysia, Canada, Dubai, Vietnam and in Pakistan.

I'm a **PhD student** at the **Department of Computer Sciences** at <a href="https://tec.mx/es" target="_blank">*TecnolÃ³gico de Monterrey</a> ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ and <a href="https://www.univ-lorraine.fr" target="_blank">**UniversitÃ© de Lorraine</a> ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

Currently I'm working in kidney stone classification in endoscopic images at the [CV-INSIDE Lab](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/CV-INSIDE-Computer-Vision-for-Image-aNalysiS-bIomeDical-Engineering-Gilberto-Ochoa-Ruiz) under the direction of [*Gilberto Ochoa-Ruiz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DDtiliwAAAAJ&hl=en) and [**Christian Daul](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=XPH6u74AAAAJ&hl=fr)



Most importantly, **I'm always on the lookout for a great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affogato" target="_blank">affogato!</a>**

### Research interests

My interests are in **medical image analysis**, **computer vision**,  and **machine learning**. This involves multidisciplinary research from computing and biomedical sciences. 

  
I'm now working on some interesting **projects**:

*  [Classification of **kidney stones** in endoscopic images](/kidneystones) ðŸ“Œ
*  [Visualization and localization of **blood vessels** in speckle images](/bloodvessels)
*  [Breast classification on **mammography** images](/mammography) 
*  [Visualization and analysis of **colony growth** in speckle images](/colonygrowth) 


If you want to discuss things of images, or **make a collaboration**, send me an [email](mailto:francisco.lopez@ieee.org?subject=%20Hello,%20Francisco)  or follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/Friscolt" target="_blank">twitter</a>.


Cheers,
Francisco ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½
