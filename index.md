### Research interests

My interests are in **Cyber Security**, **Computer Networks**,  and **Wireless Communication**. This involves multidisciplinary research from computing and engineering sciences including Vehicualr Ad Hoc Networks, Wireless Sensor Networks, Body Area Networks, Smart Cities, Internet of Things, Internet of Everything, Artificial Intelligence based Internet of Things.  

  
I'm now working on some interesting **projects**:

*  [Classification of **kidney stones** in endoscopic images](/kidneystones) ðŸ“Œ
*  [Visualization and localization of **blood vessels** in speckle images](/bloodvessels)
*  [Breast classification on **mammography** images](/mammography) 
*  [Visualization and analysis of **colony growth** in speckle images](/colonygrowth) 


If you want to discuss things of images, or **make a collaboration**, send me an [email](mailto:francisco.lopez@ieee.org?subject=%20Hello,%20Francisco)  or follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/Friscolt" target="_blank">twitter</a>.


Cheers,
