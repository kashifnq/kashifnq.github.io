### About me

I'm a **Associate Professor** of Cyber Security at the at <a href="https://www.ul.ie/scieng/schools-and-departments/department-electronic-and-computer-engineering/dr-kashif-naseer" target="_blank">*Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering at the University of Limerick, Ireland.</a> and I am also actively involved in the <a href="https://www.cyberskills.ie/" target="_blank">*Cyber Skills project, a HEA-HCI Pillar 3 initiative Ireland.</a> 

Currently I'm working in kidney stone classification in endoscopic images at the [CV-INSIDE Lab](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/CV-INSIDE-Computer-Vision-for-Image-aNalysiS-bIomeDical-Engineering-Gilberto-Ochoa-Ruiz) under the direction of [*Gilberto Ochoa-Ruiz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DDtiliwAAAAJ&hl=en) and [**Christian Daul](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=XPH6u74AAAAJ&hl=fr)


Most importantly, **I'm always on the lookout for a great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affogato" target="_blank">affogato!</a>**

### Research interests

My interests are in **medical image analysis**, **computer vision**,  and **machine learning**. This involves multidisciplinary research from computing and biomedical sciences. 

  
I'm now working on some interesting **projects**:

*  [Classification of **kidney stones** in endoscopic images](/kidneystones) ðŸ“Œ
*  [Visualization and localization of **blood vessels** in speckle images](/bloodvessels)
*  [Breast classification on **mammography** images](/mammography) 
*  [Visualization and analysis of **colony growth** in speckle images](/colonygrowth) 


If you want to discuss things of images, or **make a collaboration**, send me an [email](mailto:francisco.lopez@ieee.org?subject=%20Hello,%20Francisco)  or follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/Friscolt" target="_blank">twitter</a>.


Cheers,
Francisco ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½
